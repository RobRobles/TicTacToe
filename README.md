TicTacToe
=========

This was apart of a homework assignment. Build an Agent that will play against a human. Your goal is to win or tie. 
Basically, I "hard coded" the possible combinations that could beat me. I also took into consideration a 3 corner combination 
that will also result in me losing. Some other students in my class hard coded out every combination of X's vs O's which came out to over 1000 lines of code for some. My code is under 200 lines of code. Basically the way my agent works is if X moves without having the potential to beat me, randomly place an O.
